0.2.2 (2016-07-16)
    changed:
        - score decreased too fast

0.2.1 (2016-07-16)
    changed:
        - timer duration for score decrease is now shared with timer duration for tetromino fall
        - (code) informations about printing messages were grouped in an array

0.2.0 (2016-07-15)
    changed:
        - new formula for acceleration of tetrominoes
        - (code) timers were grouped in an array

0.1.0 (2016-07-13)
    added:
        - 3 project description files: CHANGELOG.txt, README.md, LICENSE
        - ability to pause
        - game box has colored edges
        - ambidextrous and numpad support for the keyboard
        - speed changes with score
        - score decreases with time
        - best score of the current game is kept
        - more timers for a better experience when pressing several keys at once or individually

    changed:
        - score system is cleaner
        - saner defaults for grid position
        - window size and position of the elements within the window
        - (code) array initialization in frozenSquares moved to Tables module and made more generic
        - (code) the structure of each tetromino was updated so that they can be created without checking if they exceed the frame (except if they are randomly rotated)

    fixed:
        - color randomization sometimes produced squares of the same color as the background and thus not visible

    removed:
        - (code) Strings module, because so little is now printed (with the cleaner score system) that it became unused
