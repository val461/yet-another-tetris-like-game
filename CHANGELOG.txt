Unreleased (2016-07-13)
    added:
        - 3 project description files: Change Log, Read Me, License.
        - ability to pause.
        - game box has colored edges.
        - ambidextrous and numpad keyboard support.
        - speed changes with score.
        - more timers (there are now five timers) for a better experience when pressing several keys at once or individually.

    changed:
        - score system is cleaner.
        - saner defaults for grid position.
        - array initialization in frozenSquares moved to Tables module and made more generic.
        - the structure of each tetromino was updated so that they can be created without checking if they exceed the frame (except if they are randomly rotated).
        - window and position of the elements within.
        - configuration parameters were moved to love.load().

    fixed:
        - the system of random colors sometimes produced squares of the same color as the background and thus not visible.

    removed:
        - Strings module, because so little is now printed (with the cleaner score system) that it became unused.
